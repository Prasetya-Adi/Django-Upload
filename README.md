<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

It's a little project that i made from following the tutorial from [Vitor Freitas](https://www.youtube.com/c/VitorFreitas) and little bit add and code that i think it would be useful.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [Django](https:djangoproject.com)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
$ gh repo clone Prasetya-Adi/Django-Upload
$ cd Django-Upload
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```sh
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

Then install the dependencies:

```sh
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note the `(env)` in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal
session operates in a virtual environment set up by `env`.

Once `pip` has finished downloading the dependencies:
```sh
(env)$ cd Django-Upload
(env)$ python manage.py runserver
```
And navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
